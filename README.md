dmenut - dynamic menu
====================
dmenut is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

This fork changes only one key mapping -- yes, you read that right! -- and is hence pretty pathetic so please, go ahead and laugh at my neurotic traits.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenut you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenut is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for detail.
