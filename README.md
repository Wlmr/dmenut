dmenut - dynamic menu
====================
dmenut is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

This fork changes only a few key mappings -- yes, you read that right! -- and is hence pretty pathetic so please, go ahead and laugh at my neurotic traits.

It also changes the font and colors to match my wm.

The font in question is artwiz cure-8.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenut you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenut is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for detail.
