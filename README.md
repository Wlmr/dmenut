dmenut - dynamic menu
====================
dmenut is an efficient dynamic menu for X.
dmenut is also sane, compared to its father dmenu since Tab does what the right arrow did for dmenus father. If you don't like this idea you may be excused. Goodbye!

------------
In order to build dmenut you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenut is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for detail.
